# PRODIGY_DS_02 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Task Description
This task involves performing **data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a dataset to explore relationships between variables and identify meaningful patterns and trends.  
For this task, the **Titanic dataset** was used.

## Dataset
- Dataset Name: Titanic Dataset  
- Source: Kaggle  

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI  
- Data Cleaning Techniques  
- Data Visualization

## Key Analysis Performed
- Handling missing and inconsistent values  
- Exploratory analysis of passenger survival based on:
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Passenger Class
  - Number of Siblings/Spouses  
- Comparison of survival rates across different categories  
- Use of KPIs and charts to summarize insights

## Visualizations Included
- Survival distribution by gender  
- Survival analysis by passenger class  
- Age-wise survival trends  
- Passenger demographics overview  
- KPIs showing average, minimum, and maximum age

## Insights & Observations
- Female passengers had a higher survival rate than male passengers  
- Passengers traveling in higher classes had better survival chances  
- Age played a significant role in survival probability  
- Socio-economic factors strongly influenced survival outcomes

## Conclusion
This task strengthened my understanding of **exploratory data analysis and data visualization**, helping me derive insights and present them clearly using Power BI.
